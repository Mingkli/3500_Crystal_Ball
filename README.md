## 🪄 About <a name="about"></a>

Welcome to CrystalBall! Our innovative project helps participants break the ice through story-driven role-playing. Each player influences the story development by choosing a role, and the story evolves in real time based on user input. GPT generates new plots based on the choices, ensuring that every interaction is unique and personalized.

## 🦋 Our Features <a name="our_features"></a>

- 💫 **Ice-Breaking**: Encourages natural interaction and conversation among participants through engaging storylines.
- 💫 **Collaboration**: Participants work together, making decisions that affect the progression of the story.
- 💫 **Innovation**: Unique, dynamic stories generated by GPT ensure that each session is different, providing a fresh experience every time. ()

## 🔮 Getting Started <a name="getting_started"></a>

### ✨ Prerequisites
**Device Setup**:
   - Assemble each device with the required components, including the ESP32 microcontroller, LED lights, and buttons.
   - Set up the devices to represent different roles (Lia, Ivan, Sophia, and Leon).
   - Assign the correct device IDs to enable communication between them.

### ✨ Software Setup
**Installing Libraries**:
   - Ensure that the following Arduino libraries are installed:
     - `esp_now.h`
     - `WiFi.h`
     - `LiquidCrystal_I2C.h`
   - Upload the appropriate code to each ESP32 device, ensuring that they are configured with the correct role-specific settings.
